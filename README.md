### We are group 3 and we are excited to bring the great power of machine learning to the world of heavy industry. 

Using our machine learning algorithms, industrial processes can employ automated error detection with a high degree of accuracy on many industrial processes, especially those where conveyor belts (and otherwise linear mechanisms) are deployed.
